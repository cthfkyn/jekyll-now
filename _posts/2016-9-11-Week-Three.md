#### What did you do this past week?

I'll be honest--I don't remember. Once school and work start picking up, all I can remember is that -- I'm stressed.
This was the first week that I had projects due, and I think I should feel fortunate that it was 2 easy ones. Since I had taken SWE in a past semester, Collatz was not a terribly hard project to do, although I was reminded--painfully--of how annoying it is to do tests. I also finished my very first 3D model this past week. I was pretty proud of it until everyone else presented theirs. And then I wondered why I had taken an "Advanced" 3D model course. In happier news, we set up the HTC vive for work, and I got a whooping 10 seconds of trying it out.

#### What's in your way?

Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle in my way is coding in C++. I remember a year ago, in the Fall 2015 semester, I had wanted to take Computer Graphics, but was daunted by the "you need to know C++" requirement. I had dropped the class, telling myself that I'll learn C++ by next semester. I never really did, but I took Graphics anyways, and it turned out ok. Now, fast forwarding to this semester, all of my CS classes (excluding crypto, which doesn't code except for in LaTeX) use C++ exclusively, and I am *absolutely* lost. Makes me feel a little dishonest for putting C++ as one of my proficient languages on my resume. But hey, that's why I'm taking this class, right?

#### What will you do next week?
When I said I was going to Denver in last week's post, I lied. Not intentionally, but I had misremembered the date. Turns out I'm actually going to Denver *next* week. School wise, I will be turning in my very first problem set for crypto, as well as setting up and coding with Ogre, an open source graphics engine. I am also looking forward to playing around with Game Maker Studio, which I'll talk about more in a little bit.

#### Actual blog content

I'll be honest. I didn't pay enough attention in class. For one reason or another I have yet to be called on, and, even though I know perfectly well probability doesn't work that way, I'm starting to think I'll *never* get called on. Obviously that's not going to happen, as much as my shy, introverted self wishes it would. Plus, we were talking about pointers and references all week. When I first switched from Java to C in 429, pointers were as confusing to me as they are now, and I feel like I can never remember when to use * and when to use &. And now there's this extra thing called "references". It's like trying to learn quantum when I'm still having trouble with magnetic fields. 

Ok, ok, maybe I would have an easier time if I actually paid attention in class. I'll learn my lesson whenever we take our first exam.

This is off topic, but today is the 15th anniversary of 9/11. I just wanted to remind anyone who's reading to not antagonize Muslims. You're being racist.

#### P.S Tip of the Week
In a previous section I mentioned Game Maker Studio. I hope all of you know about Humble Bundle already -- if not, here's an extra tip-of-the-week: google humble bundle. This week's bundle is Game Maker Studio Pro, which is a light, simple game engine, used to make games like Risk of Rain and Home. You're not going to be making Skyrim with it, but hey, it's a package that usually costs almost $2000, and you can get it with just 15 bucks. And you'll probably get better in game physics than what Bethesda can offer.
