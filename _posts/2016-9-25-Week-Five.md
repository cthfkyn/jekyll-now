#### What did you do this past week?

I went to career fair, as well as finished the Netflix project, while also having a false alarm of an interview. Career fair was just as unfruitful as past years. I don't know why I was surprised. Sure, it's interesting to talk to the companies, and a bit annoying when some recruiters try to guilt trip you into talking to them, but the problem appears when, at the end of a 15 minute conversation about my skills and how it fits in roles at their company, they hand my resume back to me with a cardstock card and say, pointing at a string of underlined text: "just go online here and apply!" Ok, Ryan, thanks for talking to me and wasting my time when I could have been getting another free t shirt.

#### What's in your way?

I still have yet to do any of the 2 interviews I talked about last week, one is because I had read the date wrong (actually I didn't read the date at all, and just saw "Thursday" and assumed, but hey who's keeping record here), and the other I just haven't started. Also in my way is Gayle McDowell's 708 page book Cracking the Coding Interview, constantly reappearing in my vision when I've just mustered up enough denial to forget about all my problems. One day I'll go through the entirety of that book. Today is not that day.

#### What will you do next week?
Both Facebook and Google interview will happen next week. I will also be working on a "rudimentary single player game" with a couple of partners, and finish a cryptography problem set. Finally, at the end of the week, I'll get to go home to Houston and see my grandparents.

#### Actual blog content

Turns out that missing one day of class screwed up my "flow". Everything that we've talked about this week seemed like Martian to me, only because I couldn't come to class last Friday and missed the lecture on iterators and the first function (equal). As a result, I have been completely lost for the entire week. Thank god Alex from JPL had a talk on Wednesday, saving me from at least one class of complete confusion. Note to self: don't go to conferences when they overlap with class days.

#### P.S Tip of the Week
Don't be me. Double check the times for your interviews (or any other appointment, really) so you don't end up sitting in front of your phone for an hour waiting for a call that was never going to come.
