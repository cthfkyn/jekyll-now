#### What did you do this past week?

None of y'all asked, but I'm gonna update you on my ear infection anyways. After 3 weeks and 2 rounds of antibiotics, in the words of my MD, "it looks like it has not received any treatment". Which is great because 1. now I get to see a specialist, and 2. I had to delay my Google onsite interview since traveling on a plane would be bad for it (changing pressure and all that, you know). Did I say it's great? I meant it's not great.

I didn't do much in terms of academics this week since, to be frank, I'm pretty tired and burned out. This was a bit of a rest week since nothing was due. I know I'll regret all this laziness whne deadlines come around next week, but hey, we'll leave future me to worry about it instead.

#### What's in your way?

I posted a question on Piazza about how to let Life know about whether a cell is alive or dead in order to aggregate that data into a neighbor count cache. I'm still not quite sure how to do it, in addition to a lot of other functions that would be made much easier with getters and setters, but I suppose would violate modularity. 

Oh, and there's that pesky lack of motivations thing. Yeah. Not a big deal, right?

#### What will you do next week?

*Not* have a Google interview. I'll also be starting on making a game from scratch in Unity (it'll be a Bomberman clone, except in updated 3D isometric graphics), finishing up the Life project (I say finish up, but I actually mean get started on), and also have time for a Cryptography problem set. Usually there would be a Marketing unit due too, but I actually managed to finish that early, so at least that's one less thing to worry about. Of course, there's also the practice programming problems.

#### Actual blog content

I hate to say it, but I honestly still don't understand Object Oriented Design. Specifically, I want to gripe about the restriction on getters and setters, since I don't think those are necessarily *evil* if you're trying to stick to the idea of abstracting data and modularity. If you're making a Product class (as in, a product that was produced to be purchased), it only makes since that instances of the class would have a Price attribute which other classes would be able to observe. This interaction would best be emulated with a Getter for the price data member, while preserving the fact that most people would not be able to change the Price attribute. This is just one of many examples. But hey, I'm not writing the project specs, and I'm sure as heck not grading my own project.

#### Tip of the Week

Guys. Guys listen to me. Go watch Arrival. Holy sh*t. Please. I'm so serious. It'll change your life. I watched it and for 24 hours afterwards I felt like reality was fake. It's so powerful. Plus Amy Adams is an incredible actress. It's so worth your 12 bucks. Trust me.
