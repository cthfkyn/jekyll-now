#### What did you do this past week?

I went to the clinic for the first time in a couple of months and found out I have a mysterious ear infection with no known origin, as well as high blood pressure. Turns out stress is a real thing and it CAN actually affect you physically! Who knew.

More importantly, in the context of this class, I managed to pass a Google phone interview and was offered an onsite interview. You guys have no idea how excited I was. *No* idea. I was in the middle of working on the Allocator project with my partner when I got the call and I had to stop and tell my mom my dad my cats my 5 friends and make a trip to my family's cemetary and tell my ancestors. No, not really. But I was pretty stoked.

#### What's in your way?
