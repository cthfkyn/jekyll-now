#### What did you do this past week?

I'm probably supposed to mention only computer science or at least academics related stuff here, but I just gotta talk about the book I finished reading this week. Except I can't really because it is a Chinese book. The book is called No More Than Skins (or 皮囊, if you happen to be a Chinese speaker), and it's a collection of vignettes mostly related to the author's hometown, a tiny, rural, aggressively traditional Chinese place. The first half of the book revolves around the death of his father, but mostly from the reactions and actions of the author's mother. The latter stories are more scattered and usually center around one specific person. He delves into their thoughts and motivations, and follows each through their dreams for the future, and eventual failure. While the book is extremely well written and truly moved me, I would recommend approaching this book as if it were a work of fiction, simply because it is extremely unrealistic that the author would be able to accurately discern everyone's inner thoughts and hiddle secrets, and the book would, ironically, feel more realistic. 

That's enough rambling for the week.

#### What is in your way?

I got an email invitation to the Twitter coding challenge a couple of days back, and dutifully started it about 2 days ago. And I was stumped on the very first question. As someone who has never written a single line of SQL in my life, I spent a couple of minutes despairing before deciding to move on to the next 2 questions, which are significantly more in my comfort zone. So currently i face the dilemma of whether or not it would be ethical to give myself a crash course on SQL solely for the purpose of this coding challenge.

#### What will you do next week?

I have 2 phone interviews with Google and Facebook again! I know, those words have been in almost every single blog post I've made. But I'm for real this time. Both of those interviews are the second phase of their respective interviewing process, and I am understandably much more scared than I was the last couple of times around. But hey, confidence is key. I just gotta constantly tell myself that I can make it, and everything will work out fine. Right?

#### Actual blog content

My cat stretched his paw out on my laptop keyboard. It's super cute but it's also making my trying to write this before the deadline a little difficult.

I've always hated pointers. I think I've mentioned this in a previous blog post too. When I used to talk about C++, in 2013 BC (Before CompSci), I would always say : "oh I hate c++. I don't get pointers." Nowadays, that statement is as true as ever. I don't want to make any of my pointers constant. I'm a trusting person. No one's going to mess with my stuff. 

My cat has increased his distraction level to 2 paws, and a nose. Send help.

Anyways, Downing's also genuinely surprising me with the amount of jokes in his repertoire. Taking SWE made me think he only had the singular exceptions joke, but boy oh boy, am I pleasantly surprised. Keep it up.

#### Tip of the Week

It is so, so, *so* important that you find someone else (or multiple someone elses) to help you with your classwork. Or heck, even life in general. UTCS isn't ranked 6th in the world for no reason--it's tough. And it's gonna be even tougher if you're trying to do it all on your own. Find a buddy, make a friend, and help each other not fail. Trust me, I'm a senior.
