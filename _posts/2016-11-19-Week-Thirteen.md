#### What did you do this past week?

Absolutely nothing, and the reason is I got a couple of really good video games that sucked away all of my time. I don't think it would be very appropriate for me to talk about them here, but I'm going to anyways. The first one is Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight, which sounds like a very Japanese title, and if you played the game you would think it is a Japanese game, but it actually isn't. It falls under the genre "metroidvania", which, if you're not familiar with it, basically means a 2D platformer, usually in a pixel art style. Speaking of which, the art style is probably the best feature of the game.

Ok I've talked enough about it. I can take a hint.

(In case you were curious, the second game is Pokemon Sun and Moon.)

I was *supposed* to be preparing for interviews this week, since I've got an Amazon video call this coming Monday, and no one I know seems to have taken this step, so I have 0 ideas for expectations. So far my plan is to wipe out the easy problems on Leetcode. I know I'm not going to have it done by Monday, but I can darn well try.

#### What is in your way?

I think I touched on that in the last section, but it's mostly programming problems. I feel a bit like a broken record since that's what I've been saying since pretty much Week One, but the fact is, I am incredibly lazy, and 13 weeks later I still have not done much of anything. So the only thing I can do is keep writting that down here and maybe my shame of my irresponsibility will finally get me somewhere.

#### What will you do next week?

Have an Amazon interview!

I would also have to start working on my first game in Unity ever, and have 1 week to finish it, because I am the world's worst procrastinator. (To be fair, my teammates aren't much better.)

Oh, that's right -- next week is Thanksgiving! So I'll be going home to Houston as well, which I'm both looking forward to and a bit nervous about. On one hand I miss my family (and my cats), but on the other I really should be at school working on that aforementioned project.

#### Actual blog content

I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this, but inheritance is gosh darned complicated, especially when the 2 main object oriented languages (read: Java and C++) have their own set of rules. For example, the concept of virtual methods seem pretty simple in concept -- parents have methods that children can override -- but it turns out that most of my errors in the Life project were due to incorrectly declared or defined or implemented virtual methods. (This is one topic where I think Java does it better -- if it's abstract, the children *have* to implement it. Unless I'm wrong about that.)

The Spiceworks talk was pretty informative, too. For some reason I had assumed that Spiceworks was a large, traditional company, but that misconception was fortunately cleared up by our guest speakers. I've always preferred small companies to large, since it seems to me that it is easier to keep the employee's needs and desires at heart when you don't have 5 thousand of them, and Spiceworks definitely fits my bill.

#### Tip of the week

Games Done Quick is an event in which speedrunners livestream for charity. There are 2 of these events each year, each of which lasting a couple of days, and their proportions have grown at incredible rates over the last couple of years -- quoting a statistic from their [website](https://gamesdonequick.com/), they've raised a total of 8 million dollars for charity. Usually the events happen in the summer (Summer Games Done Quick) and winter (Awesome Games Done Quick). This year's will start on January 8th. Even if you don't plan to donate, speedruns are still a lot of fun to watch, and you can be sure that the top speedrunners of the most popular speedrun games will be there.
