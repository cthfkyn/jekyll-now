#### What did you do this past week?

It's no longer the first week of school, and, as you can tell by the fact that I have written a new blog post, I have decided to stay in OOP. Is this a good decision? We'll find out.

In other news, I did quite a bit of panicking about The Future. Career fair is coming up soon, as well as some deadlines for applications. Those applications often require some sort of programming test, and in order to prepare for them, I need to do a fair amount more programming problems on online judges sites, or so I've been told. In addition, my project for work needs a working demo by this upcoming Thursday so we can present it at a dauntingly large and important conference. Not to mention a couple of projects for school due the day before.

Oops, I started complaining about my life. Moving on.

#### What's in your way?

I accidentally covered this topic pretty completely in the previous section, but I'll recap for the sake of not having a 10 word section. School and work are both picking up a little quicker than I expected. Not skipping class has turned out to be quite difficult, especially with an 8:30, and a ridiculous lack of parking spots for the C permit.

#### What will you do next week?
I will be going to Denver to present my very, very, prototype program to a bunch of not tech savvy people who will expect that my program will look like Adobe AfterEffects, and then be disappointed.

#### Actual blog content

So far the class content has been a repeat of the first couple of weeks of Software Engineering. This is in line with what I have heard before, so as far as I'm aware, things are going according to plan. The fun part is listening to the students he call on stumble at the answer, and knowing the answer myself because I've already been through this skit once.

Fantastic joke with significant other and exceptions, though. I'll never grow tired of that one.

#### P.S Tip of the Week
I'm also taking Cryptography this semester, and in that class we are required to use LaTex to format our homeworks. If you simply google "LaTeX", you might get some inappropriate images, but most importantly, most of the guides will tell you to download something in order to write and compile LaTeX. I don't know about you, but if I can do something in a browser, I'd opt for that instead of downloading a program. Which brings us to the gist of this section: there is a handy site I use for my LaTex needs called [ShareLaTex](http://www.sharelatex.com). In addition to having all your LaTeX projects online, the site has a split window system where you type your LaTeX code in the left hand side, and the compiled PDF version will show up on the right hand side (after you press the Recompile button). In conclusion -- I highly recommend it.
