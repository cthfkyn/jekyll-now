## Last week!

Wow, it's already the last week of school. For me, it's more like the last day, and if we're getting really into the details it's more like the last *hour*. Terrifying, yeah. Anyway, let's not waste any time on this special occasion.

### Comments on the class

What can I say? Downing has a reputation that precedes both himself *and* this blog post. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I guess I'll have to repeat everything for the sake of the word count. The class is incredible. It is exactly what I had expected CS classes to be like when I first trasnfered into this major.
