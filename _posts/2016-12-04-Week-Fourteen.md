## Last week!

Wow, it's already the last week of school. For me, it's more like the last day, and if we're getting really into the details it's more like the last *hour*. Terrifying, yeah. Anyway, let's not waste any time on this special occasion.

### Comments on the class

What can I say? Downing has a reputation that precedes both himself *and* this blog post. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, but I guess I'll have to repeat everything for the sake of the word count. The class is incredible. It is exactly what I had expected CS classes to be like when I first trasnfered into this major -- a class that focuses on the practical side of code and not theoretical. As much as I loved 429 (Comp Arch) and 311 (Discrete), I did not learn anything that I felt would be applicable in my pursuit for a job in industry. This class, however, (and SWE), have both taught me exactly what I wanted to get out of this major. I have learned the workflow that I can expect to encounter in the workplace, and learned the skills that would be useful in the same setting. Plus, Downing's got a great personality. You can tell that his main goal is to have the students learn. You might hate the daily quizzes and mandatory, constant student participation, but you can't deny that they're the things that have helped you succeed in the class.

The projects were sometimes a little too stressful, but most of that is due to my poor time managment skills. I thought that these projects were much easier than those in SWE, mostly because SWE's website project sucked the life out of me, and everything seems easy compared to it. The projects definitely shined the spotlight on concepts of OOP which we, the students, might not have used extensively in other programming assignments, such as inheritance. It was great practice to write code which is similar to what we might actually encounter later. I love red and black trees as much as the next person, but it's probably not used *as* broadly as classes and functions.

Plus, who can resist some good quality computer science jokes? Not me.

### Some notes on myself

I got a job offer last week! I'd written about this in last week's blog post, but then I realized we didn't need to write a post, lol. But yea, I've been invited to work at Amazon Seattle after graduation. It's exciting, but I have not yet accepted the offer, mostly because I still have a Google interview coming up, and for heck's sake I would much rather work at Google.

I've also, as I mentioned, pretty much finished my semester up. There's one more project I need to finish, but in total I only have one class (equally one hour) left. I haven't fully accepted it yet, but darn am I glad that this semester's over. And now that I've gotten the job offer, I can't wait for next semester to be over too, and move on with my life.

## FIN

Well, thanks for keeping up with my blog, if you have. It's been fun writing here every week, although it has caused me some stressed when I've forgotten to post on the Sunday. And thanks for the extra credit ;)
