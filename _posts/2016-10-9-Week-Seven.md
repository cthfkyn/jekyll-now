#### What did you do this past week?

I took an OOP test! But then again so did all of you (I hope), so it's not that special. Oh wait, I know one -- I (temporarily) quit work. I decided that it was more important that I prepare for the 3 big interviews I have coming up. It was a tough decision since I am currently the only student on a project that my supervisor needed done in about 3 weeks. And I am taking a break from work for 2 weeks. Yes, I feel horrible, but I believe that it is right for me to put my futuer interests before a job that will for sure not hire me past graduation.

#### What's in your way?

I don't remember if I talked about this last week, but I feel that my biggest obstacle at the moment is my lack of in depth knowledge about a particular programming language. I am capable of producing an outline for a solution to problem, but the moment I have to actually code it up, I find myself constantly googling for what the right method/function/attribute is to find the length of an array. (Is it .size()? Is it length()? Is it length without the parenthesis? Is it len()? Who knows?). While that works for class and work projects, it obviously would not pass for interviews. So for the first time in my 3 years at UTCS, I'm finding myself having to actually learn what the specific function/package/whatever names are. It's a travesty.

#### What will you do next week?

Tuesday is my 3 hour long Amazon interview. I'm gonna gripe about that for a sec -- they want me to have 2 forms of identification, because one driver's license isn't enough, and they want a webcam/microphone running the entire time, AND they require a mirror to show your surroundings if your webcam happens to be a front facing one. What the heck? Why are you that untrusting of your applicants? Even if they *did* cheat through the online assessments, they would be found out during the on site interviews anyways, and no one is going to put in that much effort just to be thwarted a few weeks later. Ok, end rant. Other than Amazon I have a pretty standard school work filled week. I will probably find a partner and start working on the new OOP project, too.
