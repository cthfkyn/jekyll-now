#### What did you do this past week?

Still not computer science or OOP related, but--remember how I had that ear infection? Well, taking 2 weeks of antibiotics didn't fix it. In fact, it got worse. So now not only is it constantly bothering me, I also have hearing loss. It's great. All this has reduced me to a whining baby for the past week.

In other news, I also finished the Darwin project with seconds to spare. UML diagrams elude me to this day, even though I had to use it a year ago for SWE. I thought I was done, but, alas, the Project 5 specs were released. Oh well, one more UML diagram can't kill me, right?

#### What is in your way?

THIS MOTHERLOVING EAR INFECTION. I can't think of anything but it. Don't take your healthy, functioning ears for granted, kids. Once all you can hear is your own bloodflow pumping through your ears, you'll wish you didn't have ears instead.

Ok, I'm done complaining. Or am I?

Much more importantly, I have a Google onsite interview coming up *very* soon, and I have not had any chance to prepare for it because of classwork even though I had completely bombed my last Facebook interview and obviously need a *lot* work on a lot of computer science topics, especially dynamic programming. There's a lot of work ahead of me, I know, and being sick really isn't helping. (I lied, I wasn't done complaining.)

#### What will you do next week?

Wow, my Google onsite is next week. *Shivers*. Very terrifed, but also excited, to a degree. I haven't been to Cali in more than 10 years. Unfortunately I won't get any free time to explore, but maybe the change of scenery will be good regardless.

Of course there's still classwork -- I'll probably spend a day or two on the Life project, a couple of hours on a cryptography problem set, and maybe 30 minutes on a module for Marketing. Oh, and an indefinite amount of time on my Game Technology final project.

#### Actual blog content

2 month ago my friend from MIT ranted about having to write the game of life in JavaScript, and at the time I was chuckling to myself because well, at least I didn't have to do that. What comes around goes back around, as Justin Timberlake said. At least this simluation seems a bit more fun than Darwin. But I might be counting my chickens before they hatch.

In terms of what we did in class, since I missed class last Friday, I am yet again lost. I've never seen 2 ampersands before. What the heck. I was confused enough with just one. Is it the same as the move operation? Is it 2 completely separate things? Who knows?? All I know is that I'm glad I didn't get called on this week and make a complete fool of myself.

#### Tip of the Week

Hopefully everyone has heard of Three.js, but just in case you haven't -- there's this thing called three.js! Just type it into your address bar. It's this cute little library in JavaScript that uses WebGL to make graphics content in web browsers. It's probably one of the best documented codebases I've ever seen, not to mention the *plethora* of example code in every topic. A cute example is by [Google Maps](http://www.playmapscube.com/).
