#### What did you do this past week?

I finally went to Devner, like I've been talking about for 2 weeks now. Specifically, I had gone to attend the ONA (Online News Association) conference, which is a conference aimed at the digital side of journalism. In addition to standing at a booth for 2 days and repeating the same script about our product to everyone who stops by, I also got a chance to walk around Denver downtown (which is absolutely beautiful, especially because of the chill weather), as well as have my first sushirrito! All in all it was a great experience, from the professional side of things to the recreational. 

#### What's in your way?

I somehow landed 2 big interviews, both coming up in the next week, with absolutely 0 preparation. Currently I'm stressed out of my mind trying to finish class projects and read through the entirety of  Cracking the Coding interview and still trying to squeeze out some time to finish competitive programming problems. Will report back next week on how it all went.

#### What will you do next week?
As I mentioned before--2 interviews. Not much more to say about that. There is also career fair coming up on Tuesday, which I will mostly definitely go to. Even if I do end up doing well in the interviews I already have planned, I can at least score a tote full of swag and enough T shirts to last me until the next career fair.

#### Actual blog content

Classes this week included a rundown of the Netflix project on Monday and a talk fromm Chris Martin on Wednesday. I was gone for the conference on Friday, so I'm not sure what happened in that class. I had already heard all about the Netflix project from my previous semester in SWE; Chris Martin's Bloomberg talk was a rerun for me as well, except for the new, updated memes that he had added. So there was not really much of interest for me this week. I remember last year I was so inspired by Chris's talk that I headed straight to the Bloomberg booth at the career fair, only to be turned down (rather coldly, too, if I recall correctly) because I was a junior with 0 work experience. 

#### P.S Tip of the Week
This week's Tip of the Week doesn't have a concrete link to go with it. Instead, I want to remind everyone to always have some concrete copies of your resume on hand, at all times. (Yes that was a repetitive sentence. It was for emphasis's sake.) At the conference, our booth was swarmed with people trying to recruit us, and I would have missed out on a lot of opportunities if I didn't emergency print out copies of my resume at the hotel that very morning. *Always* have your resume on you. You never know when a recruiter will ask for it.
