#### What did you do this past week?

I played an obscene amount of Pokemon Moon, but it paid off -- I got a job offer! What does Pokemon Moon have to do with me getting a job offer, you ask? It doesn't, I'm just trying to justify the 36 hours I've already spent on it and not on my numerous projects due this upcoming week. 

But seriously, I, a transfer into Computer Science, who's really only taken 2 years of CS classes, got a job offer for one of the biggest tech companies in the US. Truly an inspirational story if I've ever heard one. I saw the email at 1 am and immediately woke up everyone in my family and then could not sleep all night even though I had to drive 3 hours back to Austin the next day. Probably the most excited I've ever been in my entire life.

#### What's in your way?

Oh dear, where do I even start. I, being the smart, responsible student I am, spent too long on my 3DS and absolutely 0 time on the project that is due tomorrow (Monday). Not sure how I'll handle that yet, but I'm sure *something* will work out. Something always does. Right?

There's also another project due on Wednesday, and a web module for Marketing due Friday, and a test in Cryptography on Wednesday. I'm gonna have a busy week. But I think it was worth it to have spent 5 days fully enjoying my thanksgiving holidays.

#### What will you do next week?

This section was pretty well covered in the previous one, I think. Mostly just doing homework and projects that I had neglected over the past week.

#### Actual Blog Content

So I have a confession to make. I didn't go to class Monday. Which means that the entirety of last week I did not attend any classes. As a result I have absolutely nothing to put here.

#### Tip of the Week

There's this amazing restaurant near campus called Aster's Ethopian food that doesn't get nearly enough love, so I'm giving it a shout out here. I go there about once a week, sometimes more, so that should give you some indication of how good it is (or just how weird I am, idk). It's ethiopian food, so it's heavily cooked food in Ethopian spices that you eat with your hands by scooping it up with injera, which is this spongy, pancake-y bread. Everything that they make is absolutely delicious, and I'm sure anyone who has been would tell you the same. If you go during their lunch buffets, it will be the best $9.99 you have ever spent.
